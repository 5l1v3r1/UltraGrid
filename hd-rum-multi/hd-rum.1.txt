== NAME ==
hd-rum - simple UDP packet reflector

== SYNOPSIS ==
*hd-rum* 'BUF_SIZE' 'PORT' 'ADDRESSES'

== OPTIONS ==
*BUF_SIZE*::
    size of network buffer (eg. 8M)

*PORT*::
    UDP port number to retransmit

*ADDRESSES*::
    list of addresses to transmit to (separated by spaces)

* does not support IPv6
* program occupies exactly one CPU core even if there is no traffic because of busy-waiting loop (*hd-rum-transcode(1)* does not)
